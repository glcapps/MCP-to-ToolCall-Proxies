Understanding MCP vs Tool Use: What the Model-Context Protocol (MCP) Really Provides Developers

When building advanced LLM-powered applications, developers often find themselves needing to coordinate tool usage, manage stateful interactions, and feed structured context back into the model. The question becomes:
	•	Should you use tool use alone, implemented directly in your orchestration logic?
	•	Or should you adopt a structured protocol like the Model-Context Protocol (MCP)?

This article explores what MCP brings to the table — how it differs from ad hoc tool integration, what resources it standardizes, and how it’s shaping cross-vendor AI tooling.

📖 What Is MCP?

The Model-Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard introduced by Anthropic in 2024. It defines how structured data — such as memory, goals, tool use, results, and message threads — should be presented to and interpreted by a language model.

MCP is designed to allow any AI system — not just a specific vendor’s — to:
	•	Understand structured tool invocation
	•	Track and revise stateful memory
	•	Reason over multi-turn conversations
	•	Coordinate tool planning and retries

Since its release:
	•	OpenAI adopted MCP in early 2025 across its Assistants API and Agents SDK.
	•	Google DeepMind and Microsoft also committed to supporting the protocol.
	•	It is now positioned as a cross-platform, interoperable protocol akin to the USB-C of model interfaces.

⚙️ Tool Use: The Primitive Building Block

Before MCP, most developers worked directly with tool use primitives:
	•	The model proposes a function call
	•	The developer or backend runs that tool
	•	The result is formatted and sent back
	•	The model continues from there

This works well, but it puts the burden on you — the developer — to:
	•	Manage retries
	•	Format tool outputs intelligibly
	•	Track tool phases
	•	Stitch together memory

You can build all of this yourself. But that’s the point — MCP exists to standardize and offload this.

🧭 What MCP Adds

MCP introduces a model-aligned, structured interaction schema. Its features include:

1. 📜 Typed Message and Event Flow

MCP introduces typed message events like:
	•	tool_use_requested
	•	tool_use_succeeded
	•	state_delta
	•	messages_snapshot

This standardizes model-agent interactions and lets the model plan and act within a known structure.

2. 📝 Descriptive Tool Results

MCP formalizes the inclusion of a prompt field in tool results:

{
  "type": "tool_use_succeeded",
  "content": {
    "prompt": "Fetched 3 open orders for user ID 123."
  }
}

This human-readable summary is optimized for model ingestion — better than raw JSON alone.

3. 🧠 Memory and Goal Tracking

MCP supports structured memory — but it’s important to clarify that this is not model-internal memory in the strict sense. Since language models are stateless between inference calls, the stateful memory in MCP is maintained by the hosting system, not the model itself.

What MCP provides is a standardized mechanism for updating and supplying this memory in a way the model expects. For example:

{
  "type": "state_delta",
  "updates": [
    { "path": "memory.goals", "value": ["Verify user identity"] }
  ]
}

This lets the model build and update persistent internal state over multiple turns.

4. 🔄 Autonomous Flow and Retry Control

Within MCP, models can:
	•	Retry failed tools with revised arguments
	•	Skip tool use if unnecessary
	•	Switch tools mid-process

This gives you flow logic without writing a control loop.

5. 📦 File, Vector Store, and Context Attachment

MCP threads can include:
	•	Files
	•	Embedding-backed vector stores
	•	Metadata

This makes the model aware of relevant context without complex prompt engineering.

📦 What Features Does MCP Add?

MCP introduces several key capabilities that go far beyond what raw tool use provides. These features help the model reason more effectively, reduce developer overhead, and promote consistency across agent interactions. Here’s what each feature means in practice:
	•	Retry Logic: With standard tool use, if a tool fails or produces an unexpected result, it’s up to you — the developer — to detect the failure, reformat the arguments, and try again. MCP allows the model itself to detect failure modes and autonomously retry tool calls, adjusting arguments or approach as needed.
	•	Result Summarization (prompt): Tool outputs are often dense or technical. MCP includes a prompt field within tool results — a natural language summary meant specifically for the model to read. This helps the model interpret the result accurately without overloading the context with raw data.
	•	Stateful Memory: MCP supports updates to structured memory or goal state through state_delta events. This lets the model accumulate knowledge over time, track objectives, and adjust behavior based on a persistent view of the interaction — something ad hoc tool use lacks.
	•	Event Types (Tool Phases): In tool use alone, a function call and its result exist as a single moment. MCP introduces clearly defined event phases like tool_use_requested, tool_use_succeeded, and tool_use_failed. These phases allow the model to reason about what happened, when, and why — enabling more deliberate multi-step planning.
	•	Vector/File Awareness: Standard tool use requires you to embed files or inject relevant document snippets manually. MCP allows you to attach files and vector stores directly to a thread, and the model is trained to interpret them as native context. This reduces the burden on the developer and improves accuracy in long-context tasks.

Together, these features turn a linear function-calling loop into a fully agentic interface — where the model understands time, memory, context, tools, and intentions in a coordinated way.

🔁 Multi-Turn Flow Comparison: Tool Use vs MCP

To better understand the difference MCP makes, let’s look at a simplified multi-turn interaction in both styles — raw tool use versus MCP.

Example Goal: “What are my recent orders?”

🔧 Tool Use Only (Manual)
	1.	User: “What are my recent orders?”
	2.	LLM: Calls get_orders({ user_id: "123" })
	3.	Developer: Executes the tool, gets JSON result
	4.	Developer: Injects back a system message:

Tool result: { "orders": ["Order A", "Order B"] }


	5.	LLM: Attempts to continue reasoning based on that raw JSON

All memory, formatting, and flow control are up to you. The LLM doesn’t have a structured understanding of the tool result unless you explicitly train or pattern it.

🤖 With MCP (Structured)
	1.	User message is appended to a thread
	2.	Model emits:

{
  "type": "tool_use_requested",
  "tool": "get_orders",
  "args": {"user_id": "123"}
}


	3.	Developer runs tool and responds with:

{
  "type": "tool_use_succeeded",
  "tool_call_id": "xyz",
  "content": {
    "prompt": "Fetched 2 orders for user 123: Order A and Order B."
  }
}


	4.	Model continues the thread with full understanding of what the tool accomplished, framed in natural language it was trained to interpret

🤝 A Behavioral Agreement

MCP isn’t just a format — it’s a conversation contract. The model has been trained to:
	•	Interpret tool_use_requested as a planning step
	•	Expect a structured tool_use_succeeded or tool_use_failed afterward
	•	Read prompt fields as reliable state summaries
	•	Use state_delta updates as persistent context

Because this pattern is part of the model’s training data, it behaves more predictably, plans more coherently, and requires less scaffolding from the developer.

When you follow MCP’s structure, the model knows how to behave.

🧩 Using MindsDB to Access MCP from Non-Python Languages

While many MCP SDKs and libraries currently prioritize Python, developers working in other languages can still take advantage of MCP’s benefits by leveraging MindsDB as a middleware layer.

MindsDB now offers native support for MCP, acting as a unified AI data gateway that bridges structured data sources, model endpoints, and multi-turn reasoning workflows. Here’s how it helps:

🌍 Cross-Language Access via SQL and HTTP

MindsDB exposes its AI capabilities using familiar interfaces:
	•	SQL over ODBC/JDBC: Easily accessible from Java, C#, Go, Rust, or any language that supports SQL connectors
	•	RESTful APIs: Issue MCP-aligned tool requests and receive structured results using plain HTTP/JSON
	•	Database drivers: Integrate with PostgreSQL or MySQL clients while under the hood, MindsDB performs MCP reasoning

This allows applications written in non-Python environments to:
	•	Use LLMs for tool calling via standard SQL queries
	•	Retrieve prompt-formatted results from toolchains
	•	Participate in multi-turn conversations by threading queries through MindsDB sessions
	•	Interact with vector data, files, and goals as part of the MCP structure

🧠 Unified Orchestration with Structured Reasoning

MindsDB’s implementation supports key MCP features:
	•	Tool calls as queries on virtual AI tables
	•	State updates mapped to intermediate SQL steps or context-aware joins
	•	Automatic generation of summary prompts for downstream LLM steps
	•	Integration with OpenAI, Hugging Face, local LLMs, and Claude

🚀 Why It Matters

By positioning MindsDB as your MCP router, you gain access to structured, intelligent model workflows without being locked into a specific SDK or language runtime. This is ideal for:
	•	Enterprises with mixed language stacks
	•	Systems with existing SQL-based analytics infrastructure
	•	Lightweight services or embedded systems where Python isn’t preferred

MindsDB transforms the MCP ecosystem from Python-first to platform-neutral, making agentic reasoning available wherever your code runs.

🧠 When to Use Tool Use Alone

Use raw tool use if:
	•	You want full control
	•	You’re building simple model-to-function workflows
	•	You don’t need memory or planning

Use MCP if:
	•	You want model-native state/memory
	•	You want retries, summaries, structured reasoning
	•	You want to interop across vendors

🏁 Final Thought

MCP is not vendor lock-in — it’s vendor escape velocity.

It gives you a shared language to interact with any compliant LLM. It elevates your application from hand-rolled plumbing to a structured, intelligent interaction — with a model that knows what to do with it.

If you’re building anything beyond the trivial, MCP is worth adopting.
